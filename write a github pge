            <h1>For Edith</h1>
            <p>
                The world feels loud sometimes. People come and go, promises fade, and it can be hard to believe that 
                good people still exist — people who genuinely care, who listen, who actually mean what they say.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I want you to know something simple and true: <strong>good guys do exist</strong>. Guys who respect you,
                who value you, who understand emotional intelligence, kindness, and vulnerability. Guys who don't run
                when things get real — they show up stronger. Even if distance separates two people, character doesn't.
            </p>
            <h2>You deserve reassurance</h2>
            <p>
                You deserve people who make you feel safe. Who remind you that your heart isn't something to be played
                with. You deserve support, stability, connection — the kind that doesn't break just because miles are
                in the middle.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I want you to know I'm one of the people who actually cares. Someone who sees your worth, respects
                your dreams, and believes in the good you're building in your life. Distance doesn't change sincerity.
            </p>
            <h2>Emotional intelligence matters</h2>
            <p>
                It's not just about talking — it's about understanding. Listening. Responding with patience. Knowing how
                to comfort, not just impress. Real connection grows where empathy lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're not alone in this world, Edith. There are still people — good, genuine people — who want the best
                for you. And I'm one of them.
            </p>
